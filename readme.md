## Project Description
This is a time series forecasting problem. In this project, you will predict store sales on data from Corporation Favorita, a large Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer. 
Specifically, we will build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the unit sales for thousands of items sold at different Favorita stores.
The Favorita Grocery Sales Forecasting dataset is a fascinating collection of data that provides a great opportunity for analysis and prediction. In this article, we will take a deep dive into the dataset, explore its various attributes, and analyze the sales patterns to build a robust sales forecasting model and answer some pertinent question on the dataset.
